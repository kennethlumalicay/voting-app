# Voting App
Website: https://voting-app-klm.herokuapp.com/

In this app you can view polls made by authenticated users and vote on them. Also you can log in with your github account and make/view your own polls. Voting is limited to 1 per IP address.

This is a project I made for FCC.

In this project I learned:
* Mongoose models
* Passport and github passport
* dotenv, ejs, body-parser

I got to practice:
* Node js
* Express js
* MVC framework

I'm giving credits to the following for some educational reference that helped me make this app:
